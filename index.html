            <h2>About 3D Buzz</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>3D Buzz, Inc. was an online learning platform founded by Jason Busby, Zak Parrish, and Logan Frank, dedicated to providing high-quality, accessible training in 3D animation, game development, programming, and digital art. Launched in the early 2000s, it quickly grew into a vibrant community for aspiring and professional artists and developers.</p>
                
                <div class="founder-portrait">
                    <img src="jasonbusby.png" alt="Jason Busby" class="founder-image">
                    <p class="founder-name">Jason Busby</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>As a parting gift due to the death from its founder, Jason Busby, 3D Buzz has made all of their courses available for FREE. Known for his books on level designs in previous versions of the Unreal Engine, Busby passed away in 2017 from cancer. 3D Buzz never recovered from that loss, it did not generate new content, and at the same time, some of its available courses were out of date. Still, everything is free and a lot is still useful for new and beginning game developers and designers. The video tutorials are in mp4 format so all video players should play these without any issues. There is 225GB's worth of content!</p>
                
                <h3>Mission and Impact</h3>
                <p>Their mission was to deliver comprehensive, project-based education that empowered individuals to achieve their creative and technical goals. 3D Buzz was known for its in-depth video tutorials, often characterized by a relaxed, conversational teaching style, making complex topics approachable. Many professionals in the games and VFX industries today credit 3D Buzz for providing foundational knowledge early in their careers.</p>
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>While 3D Buzz ceased operations, its vast library of content remains a valuable resource. This archive aims to preserve and organize that legacy, allowing a new generation to benefit from the wealth of knowledge shared by the 3D Buzz team. The focus remains on education, community, and fostering creativity, honoring the spirit of the original platform.</p>
